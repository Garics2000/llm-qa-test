# Customer Support LLM QA System Test Report

## 1. Test Overview

The test suite evaluates the Customer Support LLM QA system across two main dimensions:
1. Response Quality (similarity and semantic accuracy)
2. Response Time Performance

### Success Criteria
- Similarity Score ≥ 0.8
- BERTScore ≥ 0.8
- Response Time ≤ 2.0 seconds

## 2. Test Results

### 2.1 Response Quality Tests

| Test Case | Similarity | BERTScore | Result | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Return Policy | 0.66 | 0.90 | ❌ FAIL | Good semantic understanding (BERTScore) but low lexical similarity |
| Order Tracking | 0.94 | 0.98 | ✅ PASS | Strong match on both metrics |
| International Shipping | 1.00 | 1.00 | ✅ PASS | Perfect match |
| Refund Process | 0.66 | 0.85 | ❌ FAIL | Response too verbose, low similarity |
| Password Reset | 0.94 | 0.96 | ✅ PASS | Strong match on both metrics |
| Item Exchange | 0.99 | 0.92 | ✅ PASS | Strong match on both metrics |
| Order Cancellation | 0.97 | 0.96 | ✅ PASS | Strong match on both metrics |

### 2.2 Performance Tests

| Test Case | Response Time (s) | Result | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Hi | 2.02 | ❌ FAIL | Slightly exceeded time limit |
| Hello | 1.94 | ✅ PASS | Within time limit |
| Bye | 0.59 | ✅ PASS | Fast response |
| Roman Empire Summary | 2.65 | ❌ FAIL | Complex query, exceeded time limit |
| Quantum Mechanics | 2.41 | ❌ FAIL | Complex query, exceeded time limit |

## 3. Summary Statistics

### 3.1 Response Quality
- Total Tests: 7
- Passed: 5 (71.4%)
- Failed: 2 (28.6%)
- Average Similarity: 0.88
- Average BERTScore: 0.94

### 3.2 Performance
- Total Tests: 5
- Passed: 2 (40%)
- Failed: 3 (60%)
- Average Response Time: 1.92s
- Fastest Response: 0.59s (Bye)
- Slowest Response: 2.65s (Roman Empire query)

## 4. Key Findings

1. Response Quality:
   - High success rate with standard queries (71.4%)
   - Strong semantic understanding (high BERTScores)
   - Issues with verbose responses affecting similarity scores

2. Performance:
   - Simple queries generally meet time requirements
   - Complex queries consistently exceed time threshold
   - Response times show high variability (0.59s - 2.65s)

## 5. Recommendations

1. Response Quality Improvements:
   - Implement response length optimization
   - Try to fine-tune similarity thresholds

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement response caching for common queries
   - As on option, try to optimize initial model loading time

## 6. Conclusions

The system shows strong semantic accuracy but needs improvement in response conciseness and performance optimization. While simple queries generally perform well, complex queries require additional optimization to meet performance requirements.
